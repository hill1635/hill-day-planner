# hill-day-planner

This weeks assignment was to create a day planner that displayed current date, changed colors depending on the time, saved tasks when the save button was clicked, and retrieved tasks when the page refreshed.  First I created the HTML structure with rows, divs, textareas, and buttons.  The next step was figuring out how to get the current date to display.  Momentjs was used to pull the date and the text was changed by grabbing the #currentday p-element.  After that came the colors...

First, I stored the time generated by Momentjs in a variable and added "data-time" attributes to the rows to be able to reference later.  After a good deal of thinking, I added id attributes with numbers ("-#") to the rows and textareas.  Now the fun starts.  I created a for loop to create variables for each row's "data-time" and textarea and then coded if statements to change the background color for each textarea.  Variables were created for the "next hour" to be able to expand on the "present hour" parameters and contain it within the hour.  For some reason, 9AM was not playing nice and color coding the way it should have been.  Formatting was the obvious issue.  After much trial and error, formatting both Momentjs and data-time attributes to military time seemed to alleviate any issues.

After the colors were dialed in, an onclick event for the buttons was created by adding numbered ids ("-#") and creating a for loop to cycle through the buttons.  Accomplishment #1 was to get the Save button to grab the textarea input.  Easier said than done.  A lot of failed attempts at trying to traverse the DOM.  Much frustration and a little crying (kidding) later, I worked it out.  From there, it was local storage time and with some heavy influence from one of the class activities, I was able to get the textarea input onto local storage.  And also with just as much heavy influence from one of the activities, the information was retrieved from storage when the page refreshed.  Sadly, I could not get it to display in the textareas upon refresh, but not without much blood, sweat, and tears put into the effort.
